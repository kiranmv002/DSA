Bubble Sort Algorithm

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that compares adjacent elements
and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Steps:
1. Start from the first element
2. Compare current element with next element
3. Swap if the current element is greater
4. Repeat for all elements
5. After each pass, the largest element moves to end

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2)

Space Complexity: O(1)

Note: Bubble Sort is mainly used for learning purposes.
