# Binary Search Algorithm

Binary Search is an efficient searching algorithm used to find an element in a **sorted array**.  
It follows the **divide and conquer** approach by repeatedly dividing the search space into half.

## How Binary Search Works

Instead of checking elements one by one, Binary Search compares the target element with the middle element of the array.

- If the middle element matches the target, the search ends.
- If the target is smaller, the search continues in the left half.
- If the target is larger, the search continues in the right half.

This process continues until the element is found or the search space becomes empty.

## Algorithm Steps

1. Initialize `low = 0` and `high = n - 1`
2. Find the middle element using `mid = (low + high) / 2`
3. If `arr[mid] == key`, the element is found
4. If `arr[mid] < key`, search the right half
5. If `arr[mid] > key`, search the left half
6. Repeat until `low > high`

## C Implementation

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int binarySearch(int arr[], int n, int key)
{
    int low = 0, high = n - 1, mid;

    while (low <= high)
    {
        mid = (low + high) / 2;

        if (arr[mid] == key)
            return mid;

        else if (arr[mid] < key)
            low = mid + 1;

        else
            high = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}

int main()
{
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int n = 5, key = 40;

    int result = binarySearch(arr, n, key);

    if (result != -1)
        printf("Element found at index %d", result);
    else
        printf("Element not found");

    return 0;
}
