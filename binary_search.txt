Binary Search Algorithm

Binary Search is a searching algorithm used on sorted arrays.
It works by repeatedly dividing the search space into half.

Steps:
1. Set low = 0 and high = n-1
2. Find mid = (low + high) / 2
3. If array[mid] == target, element found
4. If array[mid] < target, search right half
5. If array[mid] > target, search left half
6. Repeat until low > high

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Note: Array must be sorted.
