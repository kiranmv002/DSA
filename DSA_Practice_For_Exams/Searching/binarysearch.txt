Algorithm: Binary Search

Binary Search is used to find an element in a sorted array.

Steps:

Set low = 0 and high = n − 1

Find mid = (low + high) / 2

If arr[mid] == key, element is found

If key < arr[mid], search left half

Else search right half

Repeat until low > high

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(1)
Worst Case: O(log n)

Space Complexity:
O(1)

Example:

Array: [2, 3, 6, 8, 9]
Target: 6

Process:

low = 0, high = 4

mid = 2

arr[2] = 6 → match found

Result:
Element found at index 2

Code:
int binarySearch(int arr[], int n, int key) {
    int low = 0, high = n - 1;

    while(low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;

        if(arr[mid] == key) return mid;
        else if(arr[mid] < key) low = mid + 1;
        else high = mid - 1;
    }

    return -1;
}
