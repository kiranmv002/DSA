Algorithm: Linear Search

Linear Search checks each element one by one
until the required element is found.

Steps:
1. Start from first element
2. Compare with key
3. If found, return index
4. Else continue

Time Complexity:
Best: O(1)
Worst: O(n)

Space Complexity:
O(1)


Examples help in understanding how searching algorithms work in real cases.

Example 1: Linear Search

Array: [8, 3, 6, 2, 9]

Target: 6

Process:
- Start from first element
- 8 → not match
- 3 → not match
- 6 → match found

Result:
Element found at index 2
